                "- **DBA Backup Validation Testing:** No matter the product you trust to do your backup, if you do not test your backup, you do not have a backup. The way DBAs will often test a backup is by restoring the backup to some other server. This requires resources that are not always available to a DBA. A MSSQL Live Mount IS a database restore. Rubrik is rehydrating the database and applying transaction log backups to provide a fully functional, read/write database. If you can Live Mount your backup, you just proved the backup is good and if you need it in the future, you can get it. \n",
                "- **Object Level Recovery:** Often is the case where a mistake is done inside of a table. To recover from that mistake, DBAs need to restore from a backup. This often requires additional storage, which requires paperwork, negotiations with the Storage Team, and Server Team needs to add the additional storage for a temporary use, and then time to restore the backup. Then to find out, the backup chosen is not correct and you have to restart the process all over again. Live Mount allows for the database to be up and running in minutes, without the need for additional storage, or configuration on the server team. If you need to iterate, you can tear it down and retry from a different point in time quickly. Once you find your correct backup, recover the object that was broken.\n",
                "- **Developer Testing:** Because a Live Mount does not use any storage on the target SQL Server, you can give a developer a copy of a databae so they can do functional testing or investigate a problem with their application. \n",
                "- **DevOps Automation:** Every DBA will take a backup before they roll out a change. Now they can Live Mount that backup, run their change against the Live Mount and see if the change will work. If it doesn’t they can tear it down and iterate on the failure all without using additional storage not the SQL Server and also preventing an outage to have to take longer than necessary because they proved their change would work before they did the change. \n",
                "- **Database Migration Application Smoke Test Validation:** Microsoft is coming out with new versions of SQL Server every couple of years. To keep up is a daunting task. With Live Mount, you can quickly recover a databaes to a new SQL Server with that new version of SQL and see what will break in your application before you do the migration. This allows for DBAs and developers to more quickly iterate on the migration process planning."
